# Ablation

A library to assess the effectiveness of XAI methods through ablation.

### Background

Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods lack ground truth.  In its place, method developers have relied on axioms to determine desirable properties for their explanations behavior.  For high stakes uses of machine learning that require explainability, it is not sufficient to rely on axioms, as the implementation, or its usage, can fail to live up to the ideal.  A procedure frequently used to assess their utility, and to some extent their fidelity, is an *ablation study*.  By perturbing the input variables in rank order of importance, the goal is to assess the sensitivity of the model's performance.

This implementation can be used to reproduce the experiments in "[BASED-XAI: Breaking Ablation Studies Down for Explainable Artificial Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05566).

### Installation

Pip

```sh
conda create -n ablation python=3.9 --yes
source activate ablation
pip install -e .
```

### Get Started

Configure experiment yaml file:

```yaml
dataset_name: synthetic_cat             # dataset name
model_type: nn                          # model type (nn/linear)
path: synthetic_cat                     # experiment path
load: false                             # load experiment from path
rerun_ablation: false                # rerun ablation if loaded

n_trials: 4                             # number of trials
dataset_sample_perc: 1                  # fraction of dataset to subsample
dataset_n_random_features: 4            # random features to add

explanation_methods:                    # explanation methods
  - random
  - deep_shap
  - kernel_shap
perturbation_config:                    # perturbation methods and dict of params
  constant_median: {}

baseline_config:                        # baseline methods and dict of params
  constant_median: {}
  training:
    nsamples: 50


ablation_args:                          # ablation arguments
  scoring_methods: [log_loss, auroc]    # performance metric
  local: true                           # local vs global explanations

```

Run experiment
```Python
from ablation.experiment import Config, Experiment

config = Config.from_yaml_file("config.yml")
exp = Experiment(config)
results = exp.run_exp()
```
### Replicate experiments

Experiments for the paper used `pytorch_lightning==1.5.7`. Due to vulnerabilities, we needed to update to a more recent version.  In order to accurately reproduce the experiments in the paper, revert to the previous version:
```
pip install pytorch_lightning==1.5.7
```

To replicate KDD experiments for all real datasets run the following
```sh
cd kdd_configs
python run_exp.py
```

To replicate KDD experiments for synthetic datasets run the following
```sh
cd kdd_configs
python run_exp_synthetic.py
```

### Tests

To run tests:
```sh
python -m pytest tests/unittests
```
